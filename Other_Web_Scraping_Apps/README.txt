Real_Estate_Scrape.py:

  This Python project involves web scraping data from the Collin County Property Search website using the lxml and concurrent.futures libraries. The script extracts property information for all the parcel IDs listed in the "new_data_Collin.csv" file, and stores it in the "final_data_Collin1.csv" file.

  The script uses the Scraper module to download the webpage content, and then parses the HTML using the lxml library. It then extracts the necessary data from the webpage, and saves it to the output file.

  To improve performance, the script uses the concurrent.futures library to download and extract data from multiple webpages simultaneously, making the scraping process much faster.

  Overall, this project showcases strong skills in web scraping, data extraction, and the use of Python libraries for automation and data processing.
